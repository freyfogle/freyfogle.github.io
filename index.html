            It's a fun but challenging business that still gives me plenty of
            flexibility to spend time with my kids.

          Before moving to Barcelona in 2015 I spent ten years
          in London where <span class="b">I co-founded Lokku</span>.
          We built the real estate search engine
          <a href="http://www.nestoria.com">Nestoria</a>, which we
          eventually operated in nine different countries.
          Our customers were all the major media groups across those markets.
          <div class="p1">
            In May 2015 <a href="http://tech.eu/brief/mitula-lokku-nestoria-acquisition/">Lokku was acquired by Mitula Group</a>. It was <a href="http://www.freyfogle.com/post/130580147055/my-last-day-at-lokku">a fun ride</a>.

          the London geo-innovation meetup. 
          We meet 5 or 6 times per year, with talks from start-ups,
          global brands, academics,
          and hobbyists - anyone doing anything interesting around location.
          Come along to our next event.

          I occasionally interview interesting people

          My career started as the
          <span class="b">
            first software developer at Yahoo! Germany
          </span>
          in Munich, way back in the early days of the internet.
          I spent five years there, and loearned a lot. Initially I worked on
          various content products;
          my final two years I was head of search and marketplace
          engineering
          for Europe. Good times.

          I grew up back and forth between the US and Germany.
          I'm <a href="/post/131903183275/where-im-from">not really "from" anywhere</a>.

            The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/12/20/sunday-review/dialect-quiz-map.html">NY Times American dialect quiz</a> says I speak
            English as if I'm from Santa Fe, New Mexico. Bizzare
            as I've been there only once for a two day visit.
            <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/static/happ/wissenschaft/2015/sprachatlas/v2/dist/#/questions">Der Spiegel Sprachatlas</a> behauptet ich würde so
            sprechen als ob ich aus Leinefelde käme, was aber nicht ganz
            zutrifft.
            Oft sind wir aber in <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heilbad_Heiligenstadt">Heiligenstadt</a>, was nicht weit weg ist - meine Familie kommt da aus der Nähe.
            My Spanish is not yet magnífico, but gradually improving. My accent
            can probably best be described as "faltering tourist".
