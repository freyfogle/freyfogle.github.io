        About me:
        <ul class="p1">
          <li>
            Currently my main project is learning the hands-on
            details of running a SaaS business. I'm co-founder of
            <a href="https://geocoder.opencagedata.com">OpenCage Data</a>,
            we provide an API to convert coordinates to places.
            <div class="p1">
            It's a fun but challenging business that still gives me plenty of
            flexibility to spend time with my kids.

            I'm an occasional angel investor
            (<a href="https://angel.co/freyfogle">my AngelList profile</a>),
            investing
            in early-stage startups I can help via
            my domain knowledge or
            network, or where I know the founders. I'm particularly
            interested in geo,
            API-based businesses, aggregation, classifieds,
            and "academia2.0".

            Before moving to Barcelona in 2015 I spent ten years
            in London where I co-founded Lokku Ltd.
            We built the real estate search engine
            <a href="http://www.nestoria.com">Nestoria</a>, which we
            eventually operated in nine different countries.
            Our customers were all the major media groups across those markets.
            <div class="p1">
              In May 2015 <a href="http://tech.eu/brief/mitula-lokku-nestoria-acquisition/">Lokku was acquired by Mitula Group</a>. It was <a href="http://www.freyfogle.com/post/130580147055/my-last-day-at-lokku">a fun ride</a>.

            Since 2010 I've run <a href="http://geomobldn.org">#geomob</a>,
            the London geo-innovation meetup. 
            We meet 5 or 6 times per year, with talks from start-ups,
            global brands, academics,
            and hobbyists - anyone doing anything interesting around location.
          </li>

          <li>
            I occasionally interview interesting people
            from the geo world
            on <a href="http://geohipster.com">GeoHipster</a>, where I myself
            <a href="http://geohipster.com/2014/10/18/ed-freyfogle-every-startup-vulnerable-thats-makes-exciting/">was interviewed</a> back in 2014.

            My career started as the first software developer at
            Yahoo! Germany in Munich,
            way back in the early days of the internet.
            I was there for five years. Initially I worked on
            various content products;
            my final two years I was head of search and marketplace engineering
            for Europe. Good times, I learned a lot. 
          </li>
          
          <li>
            I grew up back and forth between the US and Germany.
            I'm <a href="/post/131903183275/where-im-from">not really "from" anywhere</a>.
            
            <div class="p1">
            The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/12/20/sunday-review/dialect-quiz-map.html">NY Times American dialect quiz</a> says I speak
            English as if I'm from Santa Fe, New Mexico, which is bizzare
            as I've been there only once for a two day visit.
            <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/static/happ/wissenschaft/2015/sprachatlas/v2/dist/#/questions">Der Spiegel Sprachatlas</a> behauptet ich würde so
            sprechen als ob ich aus Leinefelde käme, was aber nicht ganz
            zutrifft.
            Oft sind wir aber in <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heilbad_Heiligenstadt">Heiligenstadt</a>, was nicht weit weg ist - meine Familie kommt da aus der Nähe.
            My Spanish is not yet magnífico, but gradually improving. My accent
            can probably best be described as "faltering tourist".
