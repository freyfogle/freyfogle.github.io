A few weeks ago it was my pleasure to chat with
[Craig Hewitt](https://twitter.com/TheCraigHewitt) on
the [RogueStartups podcast](http://roguestartups.com). You can
[give the hour long episode a listen here](https://roguestartups.com/rs131-unconventional-saas-growth-opportunities-with-ed-freyfogle/), or,
my recommendation, subscribe to
RogueStartups in the podcast listening software of your choice.


I have been a listener for the past six months or so - since first meeting
Craig at
MicroConf EU last November, where we were both speakers. The two hosts,
Craig and Dave Rodenbaugh offer an enjoyable, but also useful,
behind-the-scenes peek at running SaaS businesses. As a fan it was great to go
on the show. I talked a bit about how we do things
at [OpenCage](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/), also some of the
differences between life in a lifestyle SaaS business and a more traditional
start-up like what I did with Lokku previously.
I hope you enjoy the conversation and find it useful.

Similarly, it was my pleasure to be [a guest on Jane Portman's
UI Breakfast Podcast](https://uibreakfast.com/96-building-global-customer-base-ed-freyfogle/) a few weeks ago, where I talked a bit about some of the topics
that had come up in my MicroConf EU presentation.

Enjoy, and let me know what you think.
