A friend was kind enough to invite me along to visit <a href="http://www.betahaus.es/">Betahaus Barcelona</a> for a day this week. Unbeknownst to me they snapped this pic of me hard at work and are now using it on their FB feed. Might this be the big break that finally lands me in the pages of Monocle?
