I know many of you, my dearest readers, wish you could consume my
musings not just in the form of writing, but also via the soothing tones
of my voice. Well, rejoice, as I have been up to all sorts of podcast fun
over the past few weeks.

First up, I was back on [the Mapscaping podcast talking about Geomob](https://mapscaping.com/blogs/the-mapscaping-podcast/geomob-geoinnovation-for-the-people-by-the-people). Basically what is the goal of the event, what is the format, etc.
If that sounds interesting to you please do come along to our next events
[Munich on the 3rd Dec](https://thegeomob.com/post/dec-3rd-2019-geomobmuc-details),
[London on 8th Jan](https://thegeomob.com/post/jan-8th-2022-geomoblon-details), or
[Barcelona on 15th January](https://thegeomob.com/post/jan-15th-2020-geomobbcn-details).


But secondly, I am delighted to say I've been invited by friend and fellow
Barcelona bootstrapper, [Steve McLeod](https://twitter.com/steveofmcleod) -
maker of [Feature Upvote](https://featureupvote.com), to co-host his
[bootstrapped.fm podcast](https://bootstrapped.fm/) for a few episodes.
Good fun (and no small honor as I took the spot from
[podcasting legend Craig Hewitt](https://twitter.com/TheCraigHewitt)).
Our first episode [we discuss some of the challenges of pricing](https://bootstrapped.fm/2019/11/22/116-pricing-your-product-in-multiple-currencies-with-ed-freyfogle-from-opencage/).

Give it a listen and let me know what you think.
