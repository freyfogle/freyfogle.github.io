Good news, my talk submission for <a href="http://2013.stateofthemap.org/info/programme/">State of the Map</a> (SotM) has been accepted. If you want to learn more about the thinking behind our new brand <a href="http://www.opencagedata.com/">OpenCage Data</a>, please come to my talk on Friday the 6th as 16:55. The one bit of bad news is I&rsquo;m up against a talk about <a href="http://www.cyclestreets.net/">CycleStreets</a>, which is a great service. Fate can often be very cruel. The<a href="http://2013.stateofthemap.org/info/programme/"> full schedule is online here</a>.


I look forward to seeing everyone in Birmingham.
