School ends today and just in time the details of the summer are finally clear.

First we're doing a quick trip to visit friends in Gotland, Sweden. I've 
never been, and all evidence is that it is fantastic. All tips gratefully 
received.

But the main event of the summer is that we'll be Berlin from mid-July until the start of September,
living in Prenzlauer Berg.

Main goals are

 * get to the lakes frequently, especially as the kids are now able to swim.

 * get to know more interesting people in the Berlin tech scene. My long-term goal is to 
   rotate between the start-up scenes of Barcelona, London, and Berlin. If 
   you're in Berlin and doing anything interesting with a location-based or data aggregation component,
   I'd love to meet up. Please get in touch.

 * significant reduction in time spent on social media, and generally being offline more.

 * occasional [side trips to the Heimat in Thüringen](/post/1471207797/sommertage).
 
 * hanging out with old friends.

 * perhaps a trip to the Ostsee, where I have spent surprisingly little time (beyond a very, very fun
   ferry trip from Stockholm to Helsinki back in 1998).

 * visit Poland for the first time ever.

 * not spend every cent I own in Manufactum.

 * lots of early evening bike riding. Few things more relxing than cruising around Tiergarten after the heat of the day has subsided. 


Main thing still needed to make the summer a raging success is good child-care and/or activities for the Kinder.
All leads very welcome.

Ping me if you want to meet up in Grünewald, Potsdam, Templerhofer Feld, Schlachtensee, or the Müggelsee.

bis dann,

Ed
