My good friends at [Abi Global Health](https://abi.ai) have a role open for a full-time
senior engineer based at their Barcelona office (in Eixample, near Proven√ßa and Diagonal
stations). Abi makes medical advice from doctors easily available to everyone via
messaging.

It is my pleasure to be a minor angel investor in the business (_read [the post from two years ago about why I invested](/post/investing-in-abi-global-health)_),
and I have been helping them grow the business over the last few years. In 2018 the
Abi grew significantly on all metrics - launching in new languages and completing
trials with some of the largest health insurance companies in the world, despite being
a very small team.

They are now expanding the engineering team.

This is a phenomenal opportunity for someone to join a company right at the tipping
point of growth. I am often asked career advice by people - my main advice is always
the same: join a company that is growing, it will open up so many opportunities for you.
Abi Global Health is exactly such a company. 

**Why should apply you for this role?**

  * Abi is **solving a BIG problem** - this is not wasting your life slapping some banner
  ads on
  webpages. Abi is used by people to get health advice from trusted doctors. The
  questions that come in make it clear this service is having a profound impact on
  people's lives. 
  
  * This is **very interesting technology**, they are literally inventing the future.
  Read below for the detailed tech stack, but messaging
  is a megatrend that is here to stay. It is moving from "toy" to being used in critical
  situations. Abi is at the cutting edge of that trend. 

  * They are a **fun, international team of very smart people**. Here's a picture of
  some of the team laughing it up that I snapped at a Christmas dinner a few weeks ago:

**What qualifications do you need?**

  * Several years of full-time work experience as a developer. The more the better, but
  as long as this is not your first job in tech you should consider applying. The
  technologies we are working with are new, no one has many years of experience on them.
  Please see the detailed tech stack below.
  
  * Be comfortable in English. All internal communication is in English.
  If you also speak other languages that is great. Abi is currently live in English,
  Spanish, French, German, and Croatian, with more coming in 2019.
  We want to amaze users everywhere.

  * A deep respect for privacy and data protection. Our users and partners are
  entrusting us with their health questions, and our top priority is earning that trust.
  Privacy is NOT optional.

  * A desire to build for scale.

  * An understanding that building a simple-to-use, highly-reliable, global service is
  exceptionally complex. We put in the work to make life easy for and earn the trust of
  our users, our doctors, and our partners.

  * Interest in the technology of messaging.

  * All experience recruiting, building, managing a dev team will also eventually be
  helpful, though right now the focus is on technical execution. 

**Why is this a great job?**

If you want the chance to work on critical projects used around the world, to have a
voice in designing complex systems, to have your ideas be valued, and to learn an
exceptional amount in a very short period of time - all while having fun in a great
team - then this is the place for you.

**What are the tech requirements?**

  * Good understanding of APIs, distributed systems, microservices, etc.
  Abi interfaces with many different systems.
  
  * AWS / Lamdba

  * javascript / nodejs

  * git, working via PRs

  * You need to be completely comfortable in a linux environment

  * Experience with different testing strategies and continuous integration.

  * Comfortable giving and receiving rigorous code review

  * Good communication skills

  * Bonus points if you have familiarity with Stripe, have experience in mobile app
  development, and/or have built consumer-facing digital services. 

**Who should not apply**

Please do NOT apply if

  * You can not work full time.

  * You are looking for a boring 9-to-5 job where you don't need to think much.

  * You can not legally work in Spain.

**Ok, this is interesting, what is the hiring process?**

1. Please send a CV including a link to your Github profile or other public projects
to me: freyfogle (at) gmail.com

2. I will reply with a basic technical test that will take you about an hour to answer.
No trick questions, and you can take as long as you need to do the test.

3. If the test goes well, we will schedule some interviews in the Abi office. A chance
for us to ask you questions, but also for you to ask the Abi team questions.

4. Assuming both sides want to go forward we will schedule a second round of interviews
in the Abi office.

5. The next day we will take a decision and hopefully make you an offer.

In total we think the process should take two weeks or so, but of course it depends a
bit on your availability. We want to move quickly, but only if we are sure you are
a fit.

## Some other questions you may have ##

**I do not have a PhD in Computer Science. Do I qualify?**

We care about what you can do, not how many years you spent at university.

**Will this job prepare me for a management role?**

Abi is growing quickly. There will be significant opportunities for growth for everyone. Right now we need people who can take responsibility for the product - ensuring that we deliver to our partners

**Can Abi get me a work permit?**
No, sorry, you need to be legally able to work in Spain.

**Can I work remotely?**
No, we're working very collaboratively right now, and that means being face-to-face with
each other and the white board. We may have remote roles in the future.


**I don't think it's right for me just now, but Abi sounds great. How can I stay informed?**
