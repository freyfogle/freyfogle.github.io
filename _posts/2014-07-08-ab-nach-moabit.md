Tomorrow I head out to Berlin for the next two months (though will be back in London for <a href="http://geomobldn.org/post/86215066805/july-17th-geomob-lineup">next week&rsquo;s #geomob</a>.


We&rsquo;ll be living in Moabit, not far from Hauptbahnhof and the Spree. There will be a bit of holiday, but mainly it is just a chance to live and work in Berlin. I&rsquo;ve visited many times but never actually lived there, and I want to explore the thriving tech scene. Here in London we hear more and more about Berlin. As someone who runs a company of 20 people in central London the costs here are crippling. While I hear that things are getting more expensive in Berlin, frankly a cosmopolitan city with much lower cost of living is very, very appealing - und dass nicht nur weil ich deustch bin.


Which brings the second major reason for going - so that my son gets more exposure to deutsch. Right now I&rsquo;m basically the only one he learns German from. Given that limitation, he&rsquo;s doing great, but I see his deutsch more and more falling behind his English as he spends all day in an English only nursery.


Another major reason to go &ldquo;away&rdquo; for two months is to test how well the Nestoria team fares wthout me. For some time now I&rsquo;ve been trying (with good success) to get out of the day to day operations, and <a href="http://freyfogle.tumblr.com/post/90803304030/starting-a-long-journey">focus more on OpenCage</a>. This will be a real test, and one I am confident the team will pass with flying colors.


Anyway, I have a fair number of meetings set up already, and next week <a href="http://csvconf.com/#freyfogle">I&rsquo;m speaking at csv,conf</a>. If you&rsquo;re doing something interesting - especially around geo, data, or online property, I&rsquo;d love to meet, gerne auch in einem Biergarten am Spree. Please ping me on twitter.


It&rsquo;s going to be a great summer


I leave you with this gem, Gitarre M.Z.&rsquo;s &ldquo;Moabit ist Moabit&rdquo;
