Lots of events on the schedule in over the next few weeks.


First up, <a href="http://geomobldn.org/post/92562019930/september-16th-geomob-details">on the 16th is #geomob</a>. I&rsquo;m very pleased with the strong lineup we&rsquo;ve been able to put together over the last could years, but this could well be our best lineup yet. On the 17th I&rsquo;ll be talking <a href="http://geocoder.opencagedata.com/">OpenCage Geocoder</a> at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-API-Group/events/200768922/">LondonAPI</a>, which will be good practive for <a href="http://www.apiconuk.com/apiconukspeakerdetail?id=freyfogle">my much longer talk at APIcon UK</a> Sept 24-26 (BTW I have an invite code if you want a reduced rate). To take a break from geo I&rsquo;ll be heading to <a href="https://www.writelatex.com/blog/173-full-speaker-line-up-and-venue-for-number-futurepub-london-on-sept-23rd">#futurepub on the 23rd</a> run by my friends at <a href="https://www.writelatex.com/">writeLaTeX</a>.


Finally, in October I&rsquo;ve been invited to speak at an <a href="http://www.exprodat.com">Exprodat</a> company event which should be good fun.


Anyway please come along to one and all of these events and ask some really softball questions. Good themes would be variations along the &ldquo;Ed, how did you achieve such awesomeness&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Ed, are you ever scared by how amazing you are&rdquo; line. See you there.
