  * Busy week that flew by in a blur. Shamefully I only made it to the gym twice.
  
  * This weekend we had an old friend visit which was nice.

  * Was dismayed to learn that night trains from Barcelona to A Coru√±a during 
  Easter are very expensive. This unfortunately puts a damper on our 
  plans to vacation in Galicia. Am contemplating alternatives.

  * Made it down to Poblenou to have lunch with my friends 
  at [Hubtype](https://hubtype.com/). 2019 promises to be a great year for 
  them. Had a few other interesting conversations as well. As always
  when I head down the hill, I end up regreting moving away from Poblenou.

  * Next week I'm off to Germany (first HH, then Berlin) for a few days to 
  visit a few friends while also looking to transfer OpenCage to a GmbH. Brexit 
  means Brexit, unfortunately. Let me know if you want to meet up in Berlin, 
  though at this point schedule is quite full. But hopefully we'll be back in 
  the summer for July and August.
