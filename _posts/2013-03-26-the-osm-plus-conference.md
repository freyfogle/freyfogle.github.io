Last week the <a href="http://osmplus.co/">OpenStreetMap Professional Large User Summit</a> (OSMPLUS for short) was announced. It will be a one day conference tacked on to <a href="http://stateofthemap.us/">State of the Map US</a> in San Francisco in June. SOTM-US alone would not be enough for me to make the transatlantic journey (especially given that <a href="http://www.stateofthemap.org/">SOTM</a> will be in the UK in September), but the commercial application of OSM is a topic I&rsquo;ve been thinking about a lot over the past few years, not least since <a href="http://blog.nestoria.co.uk/post/43883369968/why-and-how-weve-switched-away-from-google-ma">Nestoria switched to using OSM maps in some markets</a>, so I&rsquo;m now thinking hard about making the trip.


As <a href="http://freyfogle.tumblr.com/post/43256711297/where-is-the-openstreetmap-offline-innovation">documented here</a>, I&rsquo;m wondering why we haven&rsquo;t yet seen more offline innovation. But I&rsquo;m also wondering if the free data model of OSM means the value goes just to the consumers or users of the data or is there a viable, large-scale business that can really be built around free geodata? One obvious point of comparison is open source software, where we see two things: firstly that there have been successful business built around free software - typically, but not always, via a consulting model - and that proprietary software businesses have continued to thrive. That being said though geodata is obviously not the same as software.Â  


I&rsquo;m hopeful that OSMPLUS draws a large crowd of folks asking similar questions.
