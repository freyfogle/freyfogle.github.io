This week feels like the busiest I&rsquo;ve had in about a decade. I&rsquo;ve been literally racing from thing to thing usually while holding a screaming toddler and/or infant. In the next few weeks there will be lots of traveling - the Eichsfeld in Th√ºringen, Berlin, Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, back to the Eichsfeld, back to London - and I&rsquo;m racing to close things out before I go. More on all that in the first ever week notes.


Despite all of that though, I made sure not to miss #futurepub (short for &ldquo;the future of academic publishing&rdquo;) - the event organized by the guys from <a href="https://www.writelatex.com/">writeLaTeX</a> and <a href="https://www.writelatex.com/blog/83-join-us-at-the-british-library-in-january-to-celebrate-a-new-year-for-science-and-publishing">held at the British Library</a>.


There was much to like about this event. First of all it was held in a #geomob style format of a few speakers, each with just 10-15 minutes to go through a few slides. All of the speakers were good, I especially enjoyed Dr Bibiana Campos-Seijo high-level overview of the changes in scientific publishing in the last year and the trends for the future.


<a href="https://twitter.com/DrHammersley">John Hammersley</a> of WriteLaTeX announced the launch of <a href="https://www.writelatex.com/overleaf">Overleaf</a>, their new tool to centralize the publishing process. <a href="http://freyfogle.tumblr.com/post/45748775602/kickstarter-for-academic-research">As I blogged last year</a>, I&rsquo;m an unfortunate observer of the pain of academic publishing via my wife&rsquo;s work. It is fairly astounding how excruciating some of the ways of working that are endemic to academia are. It&rsquo;s as if there is a master plan to find smart, highly motivated people, spend many years training them, and then have them spend their time on trivia and admin - endlessly emailing around documents and changing fonts. It is such a waste of potential it makes you want to scream. Good luck to Overleaf specifically, and to all the forward thinking attendees at tonight&rsquo;s event generally, who want to change that, thus freeing up the scientists to actually do science.


I hope #futurepub can find the same success in its niche as #geomob has, and help the fledgling academia2.0 scene in London flourish. Afterwards, during the mingling and discussion that is the real meat of these events, I spotted a peerj t-shirt in the crowd and had a nice chat with an engineer from Mendeley, so it seem&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re on the way.


I look forward to the next one.
