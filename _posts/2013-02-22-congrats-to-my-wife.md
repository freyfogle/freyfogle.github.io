My wife is a scientist. When we first met she told me she was an epidemiologist and it seems she was impressed when I knew what that was and responded with &ldquo;great, you can save me when the ebola outbreak comes&rdquo;. Unfortunately though, she won&rsquo;t save me; she does environmental epidemiology. She does her research at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, primarily on air pollution. 


This week one of her papers was published, and got a fair amount of press coverage. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/02/19/air-pollution-link-heart-attack-death_n_2719333.html">summary on Huffington Post</a>. She was interviewed on the BBC and ITV about it, though unfortunately I haven&rsquo;t been able to see either. Congrats to her. If you breathe you should check it out. 


Nevertheless, if anyone can help us out on the ebola front I will not say no.
