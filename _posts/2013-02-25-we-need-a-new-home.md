My vacation has been interrupted by a message from our landlord ending our lease from 31 April. Good times.



If anyone has leads on a good place in Hoxton or southern Islington - I&rsquo;m not very keen on also finding a new nursery for my son - I would love to hear from you. We need at least two bedrooms, un- or at most partially furnished. We are your dream tenants and have numerous references to prove it. 



Many thanks.
