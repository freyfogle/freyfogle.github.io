Following last month's [interview on MapScaping](/post/interviewed-by-mapscaping), this
month I was on [the geodorable podcast](https://geodorable.com/2019/06/10/episode-59/)

Many thanks to Chris and Mark for having me on the show. It's funny in that NZ, where
they are based, and Spain are literally on opposite sides of the world, and yet despite
this it was simple to relate to them as fellow geogeeks. We talked about [geomob](https://thegeomob.com), [OpenCage](https://opencagedata.com/), and some of my angel investing in geo start-ups.

Hope you enjoy the conversation.
