I’m delighted to announce I’ve been invited to speak at the <a href="http://www.sigte.udg.edu/jornadassiglibre/">Jornadas SIG libre conference</a> in Girona at the end of May. The event is the Spanish FOSS4G, the main conference about free and open source geospatial software.
I’m starting to think about what I might have to say that would be relevant to the audience, if you have any suggestions please let me know. Right now I’m thinking I’ll primarily focus on the trends I’ve seen in running <a href="http://geomobldn.org/">#geomob</a> over the last six years, the lessons learned in running the <a href="https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/">OpenCage Geocoder</a>, and  thoughts on investing in geo startups like <a href="http://what3words.com/">What3Words</a> and <a href="http://www.splash-maps.com/">SplashMaps</a>.  
It should be a great event, and I’m looking forward to it as I’ve never been to Girona which everyone says is great. The language of the conference is Spanish, but I think to make any sort of meaningful presentation my talk will have to be in English.
Final thing: if geo events are your thing <a href="http://geomobldn.org/post/139352132255/see-you-on-the-15th-of-march">the next #geomob is on 15th of March</a>, come along if you’re in London.
