This weekend marked seven years since my company <a href="http://www.lokku.com/">Lokku</a> was officially founded.  By coincidence it turns out to be the exact day we registered the domain <a href="http://www.nestoria.co.uk/">nestoria.co.uk</a>, our first brand.


$whois nestoria.co.uk

I actually remember that day, it was Javier and I working out of my flat near Holland Park with literally nothing but a laptop and an idea. 


Today we have a great team that helps us run a profitable business that runs a service used by millions of people around the world, and major media brands of the world are our satisfied customers. I&rsquo;m mixed on whether to be deeply satisfied at what we&rsquo;ve accomplished in the last seven years, or horrified at how quickly the time as past. A bit of both I guess.


Many thanks to everyone who helped make it a reality. Our investors, our clients, but most of all our team. We&rsquo;ve been very fortunate to have a great group to go on this adventure with us.


And now I&rsquo;m going to head off to visit our internal Facebook group where we keep pictures from team events and such. If you have a start-up I can&rsquo;t recommend enough that you set something like that up. Your start-up may succeed, or it may fail, but the memories are truely priceless.
