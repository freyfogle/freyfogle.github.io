On Thursday the 30th of November I'll be speaking at the
[BCN Data Engineering meetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/BCN-Data-Engineering/events/244965076/)
about [the OpenCage Geocoder](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com)
and the challenges of corralling data for the whole world.

Things kick off at 19:00, we'll be at Iron Hack BCN in Poblenou, it should
be a fun evening. 

see you there,

Ed
