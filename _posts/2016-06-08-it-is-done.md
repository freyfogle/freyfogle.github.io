After much procrastination I've finally moved the blog off of tumblr. I'm
now [making the site with jekyll and hosting on github pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/). I'm liking it much more, and used it as a chance to finally
make a very simple "about me" page which you can now find on [freyfogle.com](http://www.freyfogle.com).

Jekyll is oddly conceptually similar to the "jake" system we built at yahoo
about 15 years ago, so I feel right at home. Free hosting from github is ace.
The biggest difficulty was importing all the old posts from tumblr.
There is a migration tool, but I found it didn't work, I think the underlying
format of tumblr's API has changed. Anyway, I had to write my own little adhoc
tool which was easy enough.

My biggest regret is not having made this move much sooner. Next up is to move
the [#geomob](http://geomobldn.org) blog off of tumblr and make that look a
bit less adhoc. 

Anyway the path is now cleared for a onslaught of blogging. There is much
to tell as a few new projects are brewing.
