Like many people over the last year I have gotten much more into podcasts. Actually I’ve mulled whether I should do an update to my “<a href="http://www.freyfogle.com/post/94379852540/what-i-read">what I read</a>“ post from a few years back, as I’ve found my media consumption has changed a great deal. Bizzarely, the “old” technologies of podcasts and newsletters now feature heavily.
Unfortunately I’m struggling to find compelling podcast content in German though. I want non-tech stuff, ideally history or entertaining non-fiction. The various podcast directories are universally terrible adsense little different from adsense spam sites. Wer kann mir da was vorschlagen?
