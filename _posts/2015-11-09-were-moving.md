Following on <a href="http://www.freyfogle.com/post/131741792220/house-hunting-again">my recent posts about moving</a>, we’ve now found a new place in Sarrià / Tres Torres, and will move in January. Besides personal disappointment at leaving Poblenou, I also feel bad for our current landlord, a nice couple from right down the street who have been very helpful. If you are interested in a loft in Poblenou, please get in touch. It is 100 square meters, open plan. For a couple it would be fantastic, we had no difficulty living here with our two young children. Its a very cool building, it was an old factory but then completely renovated and modernised. All of that three blocks from the beech and two from the nearest metro. The rent was very fair. 

Please ping me if it might be relevant for you, they have been very helpful to us, so I would love to find them a good new tenant.

ta,
Ed
