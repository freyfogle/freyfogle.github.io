<div style="font-weight:bold;">TL;DR: I've invested in <a href="http://flyflock.io/">Flock</a>. They are ace and <a href="https://flock.breezy.hr/p/098e154b6289-tech-lead">hiring</a>.</div>

Following [last week’s news about Printastic](/post/1485519423/investing-in-printastic), I’m pleased to say 2017 remains on a strong start with regards to angel investing - I’ve made a small investment in [Flock](http://www.flyflock.io).

Flock is building a pay-as-you-fly insurance app for drones. As you may or may not know commercial drone operators are, understandably, required to have insurance. But because drone flying is such a new field there are not yet good tools for insurance companies to assess the risk of a specific drone flight. As such they  end up charging all drone operators a relatively high amount to insure their flights. This inhibits adoption and makes little sense: as a very basic example, a flight over an empty field has much less risk than a flight over a busy road.

Flock provides a solution for insurance providers to better assess and price the risk based on many different factors, not least the geography of the proposed flight. 

Besides solving a clear business need in a rapidly growing space (see [this post just this week from VC legend Fred Wilson](http://avc.com/2017/01/10000-commercial-drone-flights/)), Flock is an attractive investment because of the team. The founder is [Antton Peña](https://twitter.com/Anttonp) and CEO is [Ed Leon Klinger](https://twitter.com/edleonklinger), both have great backgrounds and above all passion to create a great business. By coincidence Antton is Basque, hopefully it will work out [as well as my last collaboration with a Basque tech entrepreneur](/post/130580147055/my-last-day-at-lokku). For my Basque speaking friends [here’s some good coverage of Antton and his background](https://sustatu.eus/1485273156). There's lots to like, but what I'm particularly pleased about is Antton’s background as a designer. As internet technology has both radically simplified and become immensely more powerful over the last decade, the challenge for any service has increasingly becomes how to design the experience in a compelling way. Technical skill was once the limiting factor in most start-ups, now increasingly it is usability. It’s about hiding the complexity and power. Flock is a great example. So many factors can go into a risk assessment, but inthe end the drone operator needs to make a simple yes/no decision about whether the insurance is affordable or not.

But that’s not to say great engineers are not needed. They definitely are, and [Flock is currently hiring](https://flock.breezy.hr/p/098e154b6289-tech-lead). This is a phenomenal chance for someone with data analysis skills and enthusiasm for geo to get in on the ground level of an exciting, well-funded start-up in a very rapidly growing industry. You will not find many better opportunities. If you are qualified I encourage you to get in touch with the Flock team.

One final note, Flock has put together a great group of investors with a diversity of backgrounds, but I’m particularly delighted to once again be co-investing with my friend and geo-expert [Steven Feldman](https://twitter.com/StevenFeldman). Start-ups are risky and it’s always impossible to predict exactly how things will go, but I’m confident think we and the Flock team are in for an exciting journey.
