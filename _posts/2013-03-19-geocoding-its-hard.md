One of the most interesting technical challenges we face at Nestoria is geocoding (ie determining the location of a listing). The data we get to work with varies in quality from perfect to perfectly abysmal, and we&rsquo;re trying to deal with it at high volume. Over the years we&rsquo;ve developed several strategies to try to deal with this.Â 


Last week my colleague <a href="http://www.saviodimatteo.it">Savio</a> gave a talk at a university about our approach to geocoding. We&rsquo;ve now <a href="http://www.lokku.com/nestoria-geo-system">posted the slides</a>. If geo is your thing you&rsquo;ll enjoy this talk. I&rsquo;m trying to convince Savio or another member of the team to go into more detail of some of the tricks we use to geocode at a future <a href="http://geomobldn.org/">#geomob</a>.
