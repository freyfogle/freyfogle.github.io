It was my pleasure to chat with Daniel from
[the MapScaping Podcast](https://mapscaping.com/blogs/the-mapscaping-podcast),
a great new series about interesting developments in the world of geo. I
recommend subscribing. 

We chat about what we're up to at
[OpenCage](https://opencagedata.com/), the challenge of geocoding, and general
trends in the geoindustry. It was a nice conversation. Give it a listen, or for those who prefer to read
[you can find the transcript here](https://mapscaping.com/blogs/the-mapscaping-podcast/geocoding-translating-between-machines-and-humans).
