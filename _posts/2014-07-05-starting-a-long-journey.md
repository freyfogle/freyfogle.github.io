<ul><li>I do not own any device or technology to read an &ldquo;e-book&rdquo;.</li>
<li>My phone is four and a half years old, most apps don&rsquo;t work on it and I can no longer upgrade to newer versions of the operating system. This is not that big a problem as I have only three or four apps installed to begin with.</li>
<li>I type with basically four fingers, and not particularly quickly.</li>
<li>Nothing in my home could in any way be considered a part of the internet of things.</li>
<li>I do not have any devices to monitor my heart rate or really any aspect of my physical well being.</li>
<li>I do not play video games.</li>
<li>When I want to know what time it is I look at my analog wrist watch.</li>
<li>I do not truly understand how a computer works,</li>
</ul>
And yet &hellip;


my colleagues and I are embarking on a new digital project, we are creating a service that lets anyone with minimal tech skills geocode the world: <a href="http://geocoder.opencagedata.com/">the OpenCage Geocoder</a>.


This will not be easy. The world is a crazy place and geographic names reflect that. Users expect perfection, and it&rsquo;s not very hard to find examples that make any geocoder look foolish. Gary <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/13/google-maps-geocoder">captured the nuances of the challenge well</a>.


We&rsquo;re a small team. Very small in that it&rsquo;s myself (and not even all of my time) and Marc Tobias and bits and pieces of other people&rsquo;s time <a href="http://blog.lokku.com/post/90102630018/traditions">now that Gary has left us</a>, so obviously we&rsquo;ll have to work smart. It&rsquo;s possible only because our service isn&rsquo;t actually a geocoder so much as it&rsquo;s a geocoder aggregator. We provide a single API to many different open geocoders, all the usual suspects and Nestoria&rsquo;s. Hopefully we can add more, especially country specific geocoders. 


Aggregation is a game we know from Nestoria. It&rsquo;s far from trivial to do well. We know this will be a long slow journey. We&rsquo;re starting. <a href="http://geocoder.opencagedata.com/api.html#quickstart">Start here if you want to join us</a>.
