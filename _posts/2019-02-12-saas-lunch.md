As aannounced in [my 2019 goals](/post/goals-for-2019), one of the things I wanted to
work on this year was creating more of a community around bootstrapping SaaS founders
here in Barcelona. I love my company, but working remotely can be a bit lonely at times,
and the few times I've met up with other micro- or boostrapping- SaaS founders (as
opposed to businesses on the tradional angel and then VC-funding path) has always been
very both fun and useful. I'd like to make it more of a regular thing. 

So, in that spirit, our first meetup will be a lunch on Thursday, the 28th of February,
probably in Poble Sec. Guest of honor will be my friend [Craig Hewitt](https://twitter.com/TheCraigHewitt) - 
founder of [Castos](https://castos.com/) and [SalesCamp](https://salescamp.io/), and
co-host of the the [RogueStartups podcast](http://roguestartups.com) - who is visiting
Barcelona for a few days.

Our agenda for the lunch will consist of trading war stories from the front lines of
the battle for recurring revenue while eating good food. It should be fun.
