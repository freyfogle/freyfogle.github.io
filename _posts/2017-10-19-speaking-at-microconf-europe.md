Great news: my proposal to speak at
[MicroConf Europe](http://www.microconfeurope.com) has been accepted!


From the 12-14th of November I'll be in Lisbon, listening to and learning
from fellow founders of bootstrapped businesses. If you're unfamiliar with
MicroConf and have a self-funded digital business you should stop reading
this and immediately go watch all the videos of speakers from past conferences.
It is a treasure trove of hard-won knownledge from founders for founders.

I'm looking forward to telling our story at
[OpenCage](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com) and sharing a few lessons
we've learned along the way. I think the main focus of my talk will be on
building a gloabl customer base - too many of the examples I see are too US
centric and thus not always applicable to European founders. Nevertheless, if
you've been following our progress please do send me any suggestions you have
for topics you'd like me to cover in the talk.


This will also be my first trip to Lisbon, about which I've heard many great
things. It often gets compared (favourably) to Barcelona. All recommendations
welcome as I'll probably go a day or two ahead of the conference to be able
to explore a bit.

adeus,

Ed
