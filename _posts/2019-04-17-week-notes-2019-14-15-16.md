After a bit of a laziness-induced haitus I am back to doing week notes.

You, gentlereader, find me penning these notes from 
[the ancesteral homeland](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eichsfeld) where 
the kids and I are visiting the grandparents over Easter. It is geat, lots of 
hiking and swiming.

Merging the highlights from the last few weeks:

  * My amigo [Muthu](https://twitter.com/muthukumarceg) hosted the first #geomobMUC in Munich. Thank you, Muthu! Due to Easter break I couldn't make it, but [sounds like it was a great event](https://community.esri.com/groups/geodev-germany/blog/2019/04/16/r%C3%BCckblick-geomobmuc-meetup-april-2019). One step closer to global domination for geomob. Which is nice.

  * managed to celerbate another fun #notbrexitday! Looking forward to the next one.

  * made it to [the August Sander exhibit in Barcelona](https://www.timeout.com/barcelona/art/august-sander-people-of-the-20th-century). I had seen many of these portraits before, but many years ago and regardless always a delight to revisit.

  * Went to Mallorca for the first time, and it was fantastic:
