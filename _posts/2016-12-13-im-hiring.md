Well I'm not actually hiring, but many of the start-ups I've invested in are.

As the end of the year is a natural time for people to reflect and ponder
making a move to something new, I thought I'd feature some of these
opportunities at these rapidly growing companies.

Whenever I'm asked for career advice I reflect on something
I heard in business school (unfortunately I don't recall the speaker):
**find a company that is attacking an opportunity, not one that is defending**.
Growth opens so many doors to the business and chances for learning and
career advancement.

**All of these companies are attacking**. You will work hard and learn an immense
amount. 

If any of the roles interest you please contact the relevant company directly,
though of course I'm happy to also explain why I think they're great.
