 A busy and productive week:


  * With hard brexit looming, I spent #notbrexitday in Berlin, where we signed
  the papers to create a GmbH which now owns OpenCage Data Ltd.
  Frankly it was a bit stressful to try to organize everything over the last few
  weeks, but we managed to get it done. In the coming weeks we will transfer
  the operations of the UK Limited company to the GmbH.
  Brexit does indeed mean Brexit, which is a shame.

  * Was good to be back in Berlin, albeit just for one night. Managed to meet
  up with some friends

  * Saturday afternoon the kids and I "helped" my friends at
  [Abi Global Health](https://abi.ai/)
  move to their new office, which is fantastic. 

  * Saturday night my wife booked us tickets to see [Keersmaeker](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Teresa_De_Keersmaeker)'s _Achterland_ at the
  [Mercat de les Flors](http://mercatflors.cat/). It was excellent, and
  afterwards we had a great dinner.

  * Feels great to be exercising again and even managed to make is swimming
  with the kids one day.
