I spend a fair chunk of my time advising start-ups. My new - though hardly 
revolutionary - strategy is that any time I find myself giving the same 
advice for the third time to post it here on the blog so I can more easily 
share it in the future. 
This worked well with my post about 
[attracting talent](/post/attracting-talent), which I find myself sharing 
constantly. 

In the last week two different companies have asked me how to accelerate
implementation (and thus sales) with enterprise customers. 

We often faced this at my start-up, where our customers were large 
media companies.
We would meet with and convince the marketing guy to become a customer. We 
would agree commercial terms. But then, to actually start, 
we would need the potential customer to send us a data feed. This required
some small amount of engineering work. Some customers would get it done in 
a day. But bigger companies would often stall at this step and then the 
momentum behind the deal would fade. Things would grind to a halt just as we 
could imagine the sweet sound of a customers transfer landing in our bank 
account. It can be a very demoralising situation when your tiny start-up has 
finally succeeded in convincing the big guy to become a customer, but then 
stalls at the final hurdle to collecting the cash.

This situation will be familiar to anyone who has sold a product that 
requires customer implementation or integration. Often the decision maker of 
the purchase does not control, and has only little influence over, the resources
needed to execute the implementation.
By coincidence, just as I was reaching for the digital quill to start drafting 
this post, I listened to this week's 
[Startups for the rest of us episode (number 463)](https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-463-troubleshooting-enterprise-sales-a-founder-hotseat-with-david-heller) 
which covers some approches to this very topic. You should definitely give that 
a listen.

So what to do when you see your lucrative deal landing on the bottom of the 
customers's lengthy todo list? My thoughts:

First up, you need to accept in enterprise sales there is no silver bullet
and that no amount of will power and determination will be able to accelerate 
every deal. While there are things you can try to push things forward, they
won't always work. The only real solution is to have many discussions going 
at any given time, so that you can then pounce on those that are ready to 
move forward.

Secondly, it's critical to make the barrier to implementation as trivial as 
possible. Provide well documented SDKs for example. But this is obvious stuff, 
and what we often found is that the marketing guy wouldn't even pass that 
stuff on to the engineers. He would go to the CTO, the CTO would be busy and 
just say "we're busy, come back next quarter" and our lovingly tended 
documentation would never even get looked at.

How do we overcome that?

  * Give (in writing) the customer a **clear set of next steps**. The worse thing
  that can happen is if the customer start improvising a set of next steps.
  As soon as they say they want to do the deal layout exactly your list of 
  the next steps, how long each step normally takes, who does what, etc. Not 
  just the implementation but also the announcement and promoton of the deal.
  Every step should be clear, to include when the first invoice will be issued 
  and by when it should be paid. Also clear should be the post launch PR or 
  promotion of the partnership.
  
  * Give the customer a **strong financial incentive to move quickly**. 
  In our experience it was best to make this incentive extreme.
  Often we would tell them,
  "The cost of the service is normally €X/month. As a gesture of good will and
  to give you ammunition to get it going we will charge you only €1 for full 
  use o the service from now until 1 December (_some date six weeks in the 
  future_). If you implement it today you will get six weeks of free service.
  If you implement it in two weeks you will get only four weeks of free 
  service." The key with this strategy though is that it can not actually be 
  free. There needs to be an invoice and a payment, even if only €1 as this 
  shows that your contact got it through the accounting department, etc.
  
  * **Pay for the engineering** If the supposed bottleneck is engineering, 
  offer to send your engineers to the customer site for a day to explain (or 
  even implement) things. Offer to fund a freelancer who has experience with 
  the relevant tech.
  

  * **Check in regularly** (weekly?) but of course not in an agressive way

  * Use any possible reasonable excuse to **justify why they should 
    prioritize your project**. For example "Next month is the big 
    industry conference, would be great to feature you and the 
    implementation there ..."
    
  * while waiting on the implementation approach your contact about materials
  for a testimonial or PR. Basically make the case that you also want to 
  feature him or her, not just the company. This is a way for them to advance 
  in their career

  * **Apply social pressure**. Send the customer regular updates about your 
  business
  including when you go live with their competitors or peers. Ideally you have 
  a steady drumbeat of other announcements.

  * Use your small size to your benefit and **create competition**
  - write to a group of potential 
  customers who 
  are "stuck", say "We had a project get delayed, as a result there is an 
  unexpected hole in our dev schedule. We can implement one of you in the 
  next month. I like you all and don't want to chose a favorite. Whoever 
  replies first we will go with. Please ping me if you want it to be you."
  

As above, there is no magical solution that will always work, but you should 
be trying all of these things. Good luck!
