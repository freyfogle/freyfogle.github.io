I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s <a href="http://freyfogle.tumblr.com/post/43503172656/my-birthday">me being a year older</a>, or perhaps it&rsquo;s the general way of the world, but I find myself reflecting more and more on <a href="http://blog.jackcheng.com/post/25160553986/the-slow-web">the slow web </a>concept. Today I came across it in yet another conversation - <a href="http://micheljansen.org/projects/nestoria-littleprinter">Michel&rsquo;s description of his attempts to load Nestoria data onto Little Printer</a>, a device that epitomizes slow web.


A few other examples - two days ago I installed LeechBlock to stop me from wasting time. I&rsquo;ve stopped using apps to plan my todo list and gone back to pen and paper. I want less information and less connectivity. 


Is this the inevitable response to information overload, or is it just me?
