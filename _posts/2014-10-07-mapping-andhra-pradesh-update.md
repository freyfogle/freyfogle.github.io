Over a year ago <a href="http://freyfogle.tumblr.com/post/57007174879/mapping-andhra-pradesh">I wrote that I was going to start remote mapping the Andhra Pradesh region of India </a>to help with some health research my wife was working on. A lot has happened since, not least being that the area I was mapping is no longer in Andhra Pradesh, it is now part of the new state of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana">Telangana</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh_Reorganisation_Act,_2014">details of the split</a>). I&rsquo;ve mae some progress, but not as much as I&rsquo;d hoped. Partially it is me being distracted by life, partially I&rsquo;ve focused my efforts on remote mapping <a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org/">where it&rsquo;s more urgently needed</a>. 


What hasn&rsquo;t changed though is the need for more and better health research. Here&rsquo;s a great video that features some of my wife&rsquo;s colleagues and some of the health challenges in areas like this.

Here&rsquo;s a peek at how the map currently looks, still a long way to go. Feel free to join me.
