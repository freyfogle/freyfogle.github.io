This summer I'm off on a bit of an adventure. I'm very fortunate to have a
friend who is a bit of a train nut and plans crazy train trips (see this
<a href="https://spark.adobe.com/page/PCoJ5a20NeHfK/">great recap of the trip they did a few years ago which I unfortunately missed</a>).

It's all happening in mid-July. It will be my first time in Dublin (have been to west of Ireland, but never Dublin), Estonia (despite being an e-resident), Lithuania, Poland, and Slovakia. Most nights we're on the train, but we've timed the overnight in Berlin with the final of the
world cup. Ich freue mich sehr darauf da den fünften Stern zu begrüssen -
genau wie schon in 2014. Anyway, it promises to be a wild ride. If you happen
to be in any of these locations ping me and I'll let you know when we're
passing through.
