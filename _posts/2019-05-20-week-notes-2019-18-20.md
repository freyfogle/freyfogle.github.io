Well, gentlereader, as we see I'm not doing a great job on the week notes. I
chose to let other tasks take priority. My apologies to all of you sitting their
endlessly refreshing your screens in desperate hopes of a new post.

A few things to report:

  * we had [the second #geomobBCN](https://thegeomob.com/post/apr-24th-2019-geomobbcn-details). Six great speakers (thanks) and good
  discussions afterwards over geobeers. Next one will be in early October
  I think. Happily we already have a few volunteers to speak.

  * We've rolled out a few new features at OpenCage:
  [roadinfo](https://blog.opencagedata.com/post/new-optional-parameter-roadinfo),
  and [UN M49 codes](https://blog.opencagedata.com/post/new-annotation-UN-M49-statistical-codes). 

  * I have regained my rightful foursquare crown as mayor of my gym.
  I've been putting in the hours.

  * Still working on the logistics of the summer. Not quite there yet.

  * My wife was away for two weeks for a long work trip to South Africa, so the joys of single parenthood were once again mine.

  * Had a few vistors. Since Christmas we have had somoene visiting almost every two weeks. One of the best aspects of life in Barcelona is that people love to visit.
  
  * One bit of angel investing portfolio news, my friends at
[Hubtype](https://www.hubtype.com/) have
[raised a funding round](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/07/hubtype-raises-1-1m-to-help-developers-build-richer-chat-support/) to, as they say, "_go beyond chatbots_". Nice work!
