Continuing on from my last post about [the best summer ever](/post/lazy-days-summer-2019), we spent a great week in Postdam and then drove out to the country, 
specifically [die Altmark](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altmark). It was fantastic. We had great weather and one of the best AirBnB experience I have 
ever had, staying in an country house in a tiny village with two delightful 
women who hosted us.

We were right on the Elbe, and went canoeing one afternoon.

Also worth recommending was Havelberg's [Haus der Flüsse](https://www.haus-der-fluesse.de). Really well done. Aside from a 1992 trip to Oebisfelde (about 12km ffrom where my grandparents lived, but on the eastern side of the border), this was my first time ever in the Altmark. Look forward to returning.

In other news, [on 12th September I'll be speaking at API Days Barcelona](https://blog.opencagedata.com/post/speaking-at-apidaysbcn). Let me know if you have thoughts on what I should say. 


But for now we're back in Thüringen and focused on enjoying the final 
summer days.
