For the last 8 years I was a happy customer of BE Broadband and would often recommend them to others. The service always worked well, the price was fair,  and the support was excellent when I needed it (basically when I moved, I had no other real interactions with them).


Unfortunately BE was bought by Sky, I have now been &ldquo;migrated&rdquo; to Sky and Sky is charging me a &ldquo;supplement&rdquo; for not having sky talk and sky TV. Also a credit card admin charge even though I pay my bill by direct debit. In general I&rsquo;m not a big fan of paying for things I don&rsquo;t use or that are factual errors. 


So, I&rsquo;m quitting sky ASAP. Who should I switch to? I do not want TV service (I don&rsquo;t own a TV, don&rsquo;t want to own a TV). Also I don&rsquo;t want phone service. Right now I have phone service with the Post Office because it was a requirement to have internet and it was the cheapest available (the good folks at BE told me that). I don&rsquo;t actually have a phone plugged in.
