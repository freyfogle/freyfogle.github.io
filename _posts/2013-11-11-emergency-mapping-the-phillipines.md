Normally I <a href="http://freyfogle.tumblr.com/post/57007174879/mapping-andhra-pradesh">remote map Andhra Pradesh</a> (I&rsquo;m making slow but steady progress) but today the people in the Phillipines need our help. The pictures look absolutely terrible. <a href="http://hot.openstreetmap.org/updates/2013-11-10_remote_hot_activation_in_the_philippines_for_typhoon_yolandahaiyan">HOT has been activated</a> and you can help disaster relief by remote mapping. The <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Typhoon_Haiyan">efforts are being coordinated here</a>. Please join in.
