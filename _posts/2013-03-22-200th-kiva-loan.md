I just clicked submit on my 200th Kiva loan. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with <a href="https://www.kiva.org">Kiva</a>, go check it out, it allows you to lend small amounts of money to people in the developing world. For our wedding my wife and I asked people to give us money on Kiva instead of gifts and since then we&rsquo;ve been lending away. 


What&rsquo;s cool is that Kiva gives you all sorts of stats and data, here&rsquo;s a map of where we&rsquo;ve lent: <a href="http://www.kiva.org/lender/edf"><center><img src="http://67.media.tumblr.com/4e3aac502106e7051aaa8630238520b6/tumblr_inline_mk2k9siP6x1qz4rgp.png"/></center></a>


you can see it that and a lot more over <a href="http://www.kiva.org/lender/edf">on my profile page</a>.


Unlike peer-to-peer lending like Zopa (who I recently <a href="http://freyfogle.tumblr.com/post/42881969154/my-thoughts-on-zopa">wrote about</a>), we don&rsquo;t earn a return with Kiva. We&rsquo;re essentially giving interest free loans as a form of charity. What I like though is that the money goes to specific projects.


One of the other things I like about Kiva is how global it is. It&rsquo;s always hard to decide what to fund as I trawl through the projects from around the globe. We&rsquo;re not quite at the level of Bill and Melinda Gates, but it gives a small window of insight into the challenge they must face.


Kiva is a great example of the power of online to connect humanity. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.kiva.org/invitedby/edf">link with an invite code</a> that gives you $25 of credit if you want to join.
