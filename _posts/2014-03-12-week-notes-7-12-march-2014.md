This week has been almost all about Nestoria India. We have started the search for an <a href="http://www.lokku.com/jobs/india_manager.html">India country manager</a> please get in touch if that&rsquo;s you. The battle to geocode bad data is never ending, but we at least now have several clear angles of improvement. The Indian market could not be hotter, <a href="http://aimgroup.com/2014/03/12/90-million-investment-lifts-quikr/">with another $90M investment in our partner Quickr announced today</a>. Lots of work to do here, this will probably be my main focus for the next month.


Besides work I made it out to two events: First <a href="http://www.albionsociety.com/">the Albion Society</a> panel discussion about innovation in big companies, which I mainly attended to hear the giff gaff story. I&rsquo;m a very happy customer for the main reason that the service is cheap, gets out of the way, and I can control it. Previously I had been on orange and it was an avalanche of unneeded noise being pumped into my life. Afterwards I dashed over to the OSM pub meetup, which I hadn&rsquo;t made it to in a long while. Good to chat with everyone, Matt Amos shared some funny stories about the early, early days of OSM.


In a moment of literary weakness I&rsquo;ve started reading Game of Thrones and it has become fairly all-consuming. There&rsquo;s a strong argument to be made for the joy of pure escapism. Relatedly, on Saturday night I went to see Grand Hotel Budapest which was delightful and filled me for a deep longing for Mitteleuropa. About five years ago my wife and I went for holiday in early Jan to the <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A4chsische_Schweiz">SÃ¤chsische Schweiz</a>, and stayed in a deserted ex-communist era hotel. It was fantastic. I miss East Germany.


This week also marked the start of the 2014 Birkenstock season. So it&rsquo;s all good.
