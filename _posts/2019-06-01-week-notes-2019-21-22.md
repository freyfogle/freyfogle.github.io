In the past weeks I have become the squirrel, racing to gather enough nuts
for a long, cold winter. The key difference being I am racing to prepare for
a great summer.

No [wild, trans-continental train trips](/post/going-interrailing) this
summer, but we will be in the Pacific Northwest (BC and Alaska) for a big
family reunion, and then back in Berlin from mid-July. The flight is booked.
July we'll be in Prenzlauer Berg. August is still a bit unclear; a bit of
time in Thüringen, then probably a few weeks in Potsdam. Let me know if you
need us to house sit, or if you just want to meet up generally while I'm in
Berlin.

In other news:

  * Date of [next geomobBCN is set for 2nd of October](https://thegeomob.com/post/oct-2nd-2019-geomobbcn-details). Huge thanks for my friends at
  [CoWorkIdea](https://coworkidea.com/en/) who lend us their venue, it
  wouldn't otherwise be possible. If you need co-working space in Barcelona
  please check them out. 

  * Next week I'm off to Germany for a few days for a wedding, will be my
  first ever visit to Münster.

  * The visit is timely because ...
  [we are moving OpenCage to Germany](https://blog.opencagedata.com/post/made-in-germany), specifically to Münster. 
  
  * By coincidence a few days after the new OpenCage GmbH was registered
  I attended my first [NeDeNa meetup](http://nedena.es) here in BCN. I don't
  really think of myself as a "_Nachwuchskraft_", but was still good fun.
  My thanks to the organizers and hosts.
