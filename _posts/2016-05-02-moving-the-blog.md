I’ve decided to move this blog off of tumblr and onto something I control more directly, probably also with a better front page on freyfogle.com that gives a bit more background about me and what I’m up to. 

Partially I’m frustrated with tumblr’s tools (particularly the way it tries to “help” with formatting), partially I’m worried about tumblr’s future as parent-company yahoo sells, but most of all I want to create a better first impression for my digital identity. 

Does anyone have any recommendations (do not say wordpress, I hate wordpress). Right now I’m leaning toward <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> as it is plain text, which I can relate to.
