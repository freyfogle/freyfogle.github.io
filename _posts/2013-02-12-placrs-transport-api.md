I&rsquo;m not sure how I missed this, but only today did I become aware of Placr&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.transportapi.com/">Transport API</a>. This is phenomenal, especially for someone like me who has been in the data trenches for many years. Making data easy to access sounds simple until you&rsquo;ve actually tried to do it and hit the wall of licensing pain. 


Very nice work <a href="http://placr.co.uk/">Placr</a>. I look forward to the UK&rsquo;s severely needed transport revolution.
