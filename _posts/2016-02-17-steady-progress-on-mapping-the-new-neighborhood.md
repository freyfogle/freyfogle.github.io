One of <a href="http://www.freyfogle.com/post/138272982085/goals-for-2016">my goals for 2016</a> was to map the new neighbourhood as a way to get to know what is where. I’m making slow but steady progress, and it’s been a good refresh. Years of living in central London, which is mapped in amazing detail, made it hard to find new things to map.

I’ve been focusing on addresses mainly, though have also found and corrected several bad roads, missing names of parks, etc. My technique has mainly been pen and paper and then edit on the desktop, though in the last few days I’ve been experimenting with using <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Go_Map!!">the Go Map!! app</a> on my iphone. It’s ok for adding addresses, though the limited screen space makes it hard to do much more. A very challenging usability problem. 

Anyway I should have the addresses for my main radius of action done in a few weeks, and am debating what to then focus on. It’s been a fun experiment and helped me learn the new neighbourhood. I recommend it if you move somewhere new.
