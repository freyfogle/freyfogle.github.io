After a long pause here on the blog (sorry!),
I've dusted off the old keyboard to fire off a post about some recent
angel investing news.

I'm delighted to share that I am an angel investor in [Elm](https://getelm.co/).

Elm aggregates sales data for FMCG brands in the UK.

Major retailers are required by law to share sales data back to the brands they
work with. But each major retailer does this slightly differently, and
generally in a clunky way. Gathering the data to have an informed picture of
how sales are going is currently a laborious, error-prone process for brands.
Simultaneously, brands are now selling directly across a whole host of digital
platforms.

The end result is brands have a difficult time having a clear, current picture
of all their sales and supply chain data.

This is a natural space for a data/tech/usability savvy aggregator. Firstly
to solve the drudge work of gathering the data, and then secondly to turn
that data into information for brands to quickly act upon. That aggregator
is Elm.

Elm are currently in private beta with a solid and growing pool of customers.
Almost all of these customers came via referral, as the pain point for FMCG
brands is real. A public launch will happen soon.

Those who know me well will probably be making a skeptical face as they read
this post. Didn't I say I wouldn't invest in the UK anymore until there was
clarity on Brexit? Yes, that absolutely was my position. And, unfortunately
there's still not much clarity on Brexit (_As an aside, they are cutting it a
bit fine with Brexit, no?_) But my view wasn't because of any doubts about the
entrepreneurial prowess of UK-based founders (_note I don't say "British
founders" - founders everywhere are disproportionately immigrants, and that
is also the case with Elm_), but rather because of the currency risk.

So why did I go forward with Elm?

* Experienced founders [Cian Kennedy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cian-kennedy-25b33641/) and [Emily Prevezer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emily-prevezer-27a16391/) have lived inside a fast-growing digital business (they met at Uber).

* The deal came via a referral from someone I have frequently co-invested with.
Wasn't "cold".

* Solid momentum in the business.

* Clear plan, that "just" requires execution. The customers have an
immediate need, and can't build the solution themselves. Elm has created
a significantly better option than the status quo. Lots of room to keep
improving and providing value for customers

* Finally, this is again a good case of investor/product fit. I can
hopefully bring some of my SaaS learnings from [OpenCage](https://opencagedata.com/) and my data aggregation learnings from back in the day at Lokku to
the business.
