Some angel investing news - it's my pleasure to announce I'm made an investment in [Branch](https://www.branchci.com/), a continuous integration service for WordPress developers.

As always (assuming the founders give permission), I like to document my
thinking behind the investment, as a reference for myself in the future.
The decision to back Branch wasn't difficult.

* The business has a highly motivated founder who deeply understand the
space: [Peter Suhm](https://twitter.com/petersuhm). Peter has years of
experience in the WordPress space from building and operating [WP Pusher](https://wppusher.com/).

* WordPress remains the most popular way in the world to build a website (even if it's not my cup of tea).

* The macro trend of SaaS and the move to the cloud, particularly in the case of tools for software developers, continues to gain momentum. Branch is well positioned to ride this wave.
 
* Finally, this is a good case of investor/product fit, in that I can hopefully bring some of my experience from OpenCage - where we also build an
infrastructure service for developers - to the business.

If you are part of the WordPress community (or even if not) I encourage you to check out Branch. You can learn more by following [@thisisbranch on twitter](https://twitter.com/thisisbranch), following [the Branch changelog](https://changelog.branchci.com/), following [Peter on twitter](https://twitter.com/petersuhm), or by listening to Peter's weekly podcast _[Out of Beta](https://outofbeta.fm/)_ (done together with Matt Wensing). I am looking forward to watching Branch
become a critical piece of the WordPress ecosystem.
