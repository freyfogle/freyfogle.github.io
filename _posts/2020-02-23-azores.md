The kids had a week off from school so we visited
[São Miguel Island](São Miguel Island) inthe Azores.

It was great. It feels like a mix of Spain with the west coast of Ireland and a bit of Iceland thrown in. We hiked in dormant volcanos, saw waves bigger than a house, visited Europe's only tea plantation, and swam in geothermal pools.  Also good food and very friendly people. Highly recommend it.

We stayed at the [Casa do Populo](https://casadopopulo.jimdofree.com), which was lovely, especialyl their massive old garden. Also highly recommended.
