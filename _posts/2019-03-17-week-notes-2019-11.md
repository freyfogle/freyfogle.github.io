  Spent almost all of last week just recovering from a cold and 
  completely wrenching my back. Was a very humbling week, but I am happy to 
  report that I am feeling great. Other than laying in bed, reading, and 
  following brexit I didn't much done at all. 

  Few real accomplishments this week:


  * I sent out the first 
  [#geomob monthly newsletter](https://thegeomob.com/mailing-list). 
  For the first one I kept the format very basic, but felt good to get the 
  first one out.

  * Started the hunt for [a place in Berlin/Potsdam for the summer](/post/berlin-sommer-2019).

  * We had a small shared birthday party for my wife and I this weekend. A 
  little hike in the forest above Barcelona, followed by some drinks on the 
  terrace. Thanks to everyone who came. I was happy to be well enough to do 
  the hike - frankly it hadn't looked like I would be able to at the start of
  the week.


  This coming week I'm in London for a final(?) pre-brexit visit and #geomob 
  on the 19th.
