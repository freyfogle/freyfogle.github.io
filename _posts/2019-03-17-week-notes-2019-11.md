  Spent almost all of last week just recovering from a cold and 
  completely wrenching my back. Was a very humbling week, but I am happy to 
  report that I am feeling great. Other than laying in bed, reading, and 
  following brexit I didn't much done at all. 

  Only real accomplishment was sending out the first 
  [#geomob monthly newsletter](https://thegeomob.com/mailing-list). 
  For the first one I kept the format very basic, but felt good to get the 
  first one out.

  This coming week I'm in London for a final(?) pre-brexit visit and #geomob 
  on the 19th.
