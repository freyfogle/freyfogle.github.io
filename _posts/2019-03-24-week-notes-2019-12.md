Good news, my back is totally recovered and I am exercising every day again.

Main highlights of last week:

  * visited London for a [GetAgent](https://www.getagent.co.uk) board meeting
  - _BTW did you see that [my friends at GetAgent raised a Â£2.2M round](https://bdaily.co.uk/articles/2019/03/18/estate-agent-comparison-site-closes-22m-super-seed-investment-round)?_ -
  and [a #geomob](https://thegeomob.com/post/mar-19th-2019-geomob-details). I
  combined that with seeing a few London friends and walking around central London.
  I'm currently reading [Edward Rutherford's "_London: a Novel_"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0099551373/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  so was fun to walk around and see all the places. Unclear if this was my final
  pre-brexit visit or not. 

  * Lots of work on setting up a German company

  * It turns out one of our showers is leaking into the flat underneath us.
  Fun times.

  * Still hunting for [a place in Berlin/Potsdam for the summer](/post/berlin-sommer-2019).

  * Planning what to do over Easter.

  * Working on taxes. _sigh_

  * Overall, despite the trip to London, not the most fun-filled week. Still it
  did end on a more positive note, as the only two sports team I really follow -
  the Duke Mens Basketball team, and the German national football team - both
  managed to snatch key last second victories from the jaws of defeat. Nice work,
  guys, even though I wasn't able to watch either game.
