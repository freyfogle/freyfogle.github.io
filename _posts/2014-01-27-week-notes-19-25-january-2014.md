Well, I&rsquo;m not off to a great start with my <a href="http://freyfogle.tumblr.com/post/73132172349/goals-for-2014">resolution of posting timely week notes</a>, but better late than never. Last week was spent almost entirely offline relaxing with friends and family in <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heilbad_Heiligenstadt">Heiligenstadt</a>. High points included a great hike through the snow, swimming, sleeping, and building a snow man with my son. Low point was definitely seeing my 88 year old grandmother, who recently fell and broke her arm, suffering. But hopefully she&rsquo;s now on the path to recovery.


On Thursday I was in Berlin for the day and had some interesting meetings with the teams from <a href="http://berlinsuchtdich.de/">Berlin sucht Dich</a> and the recently acquired <a href="https://twitter.com/LocalstreamHQ">localstre.am</a>, amongst others. The visit was too short, but a good small step towards my goal of spending more time there this summer.


Overall a very badly needed week of relaxation, exercise, and generally being offline.


On Saturday I hoped the train down to Frankfurt and set off to Delhi. This week is all about India, and looks to be very hectic, but also very rewarding.Â  We&rsquo;ve been working very hard on Nestoria India for the last four years. Winning the trust of partners has not been easy, but we have learned a lot and hopefully now have a very solid basis on which to build much more. This week is all about exploring what that should be and how we should go about it. It will also be a great chance to finally meet some people I&rsquo;ve only interacted with online, not least <a href="https://twitter.com/geohacker">Sajjad</a>, one of our advisors on <a href="http://opencagedata.com/">OpenCage Data</a>. If you&rsquo;re in Bangalore on Friday evening and want to hear me speak about the challenges of Indian geocoding that we experience at <a href="http://www.nestoria.in/">Nestoria India</a>, (along with other geotalks) please attend the <a href="http://geoblr.in/meetup/special-edition-with-gary-gale-and-ed-freyfogle/">#geomob / #geo_BLR event we&rsquo;re organizing</a>.
