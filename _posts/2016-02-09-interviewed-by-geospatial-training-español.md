It was my pleasure to recently do <a href="http://geospatialtraininges.com/2016/02/08/opencagegeocoder-un-geocodificador-sencillo-practico-y-economico/">an interview with the Geospatial Training Services Español blog</a>, which is widely read in the Spanish geo industry. I talk a bit about what we are up to with the <a href="https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/">OpenCage geocoder</a> and my impressions of Barcelona. 

Sadly, I can’t claim that I was able to do the interview in Spanish. Quizás el próximo año?

Many thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/asantosestevez">Alberto Santos</a> for the opportunity.
