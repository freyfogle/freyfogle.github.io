**Our lineup for the evening**

Our speakers on the 13th of September will be

  * [Kim-Fredrik Schneider](http://hubtype.com) - Founder of Abi, a medical messaging service.  

  * [Mark Boyd](https://twitter.com/mgboydcom) - Research Analyst / Industry commentator at [Platformable](http://mgboyd.com)

  * [Eric Marcos](https://twitter.com/ericmarcosp) - Co-founder of [Hubtype](http://hubtype.com) - a tool to unify messaging services for customer care. 

  * [Johan Ahlung](https://twitter.com/JohanAhlund) - Founder of
[jabberBrain](http://www.jabberbrain.com/), makers of intelligen virtual assistants


each speaker will present for 10-15 minutes. Afterwards there will be drinks
generously provided by our hosts [Betahaus Barcelona](http://www.betahaus.es/)
and sponsors Estrella Damm. Many thanks to them!

**Why?**

Messaging is rapidly becoming the dominant form of digital communication, and
many people in Barcelona are doing interesting work in the space. 

Our goal is to provide a regular forum for those working indigital messaging to
meet and share their experiences. The value of the event is as much for
attendees to meet each other and build relationships as it is to hear the
speakers.

The format of **Get the Msg** will be the same as [the #geomob events](http://geomobldn.org) I run in London: we will have
brief (10-15 minutes) talk from four or five speakers doing something
interesting in the field of messaging. Afterwards we'll continue the
discussion over drinks. 

**Who should attend?**

Anyone working on (or interested in working on) messaging in any form. By
"working on" I mean founders, engineers, designers, product managers, etc. Not
marketing and PR people.

Whether you work for a global player, a start-up, in academia, or are just
a hobbyists building cool things, whether you are a digital veteran wth many
years of experience or someone new to the industry, if you are interested in
digital messaging you should attend.

Please [sign up on the event page on Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2016/getthemsg/)
so we can have an estimate of numbers.

**I can't make it on September 13th, when is the next one?**

We're not sure yet, let's see how the first one goes. Ideally I'd like to do
one event per quarter. So probably our next one will be January 2017.
If you're interested please [follow @getthemsgevent](https://twitter.com/getthemsgevent) on twitter. If you'd like to volunteer to speak at a future event
please get in touch.
