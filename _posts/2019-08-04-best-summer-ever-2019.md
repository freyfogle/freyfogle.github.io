All pretence of writing weekly updates has fallen away. The kids and I are 
drifting through what can fairly be described as the best summer ever.

Our days are spent between fun activities for the kids (Prenzlauer Berg is
a children's paradise), walking around, reading good books, and 
meeting up with friends. Work continues but at a much reduced pace.

I finished reading Mitchner's _[Centennial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centennial_(novel))_, which I had started in Colorado. As with all of his epics it is great way to learn through the medium of story. Highly recommended. Next summer I will probably read his _Texas_. I would love to find a German author who mimics this style for German regions or cities.

After that I read Kim Stanley Robinson's [_Aurora_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(novel)) and was blown away. 
So thought provoking. One of my favorite authors, [Amitav Ghosh](https://twitter.com/GhoshAmitav) (whose 
newest I have not yet managed to get a hold of) often poses the question on twitter as to where the novels dealing with the climate crisis are. Surely Robinson's books must be at the top of the list. I alos very much enjoyed his [_New York 2140_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_2140) which I read last year. 


Anyway, This note is being composed on the train back to Berlin (the new ICE line to/from
B to M) after a weekend auf dem Eichsfeld in Thüringen. It was as beautiful as 
it always is in the summer, and we managed to hit the Ritterfest 
at [Burg Hanstein](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burg_Hanstein).

This week I'm speaking at [Geo Berlin](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Geo-Berlin/events/263091646/), which I'm very much looking forward to. Do please come along if you're in Berlin.

Still to come this summer: some time in Potsdam on the water, and then more 
hiking in Thüringen. It is my sincere hope, gentle reader, that your summer is 
going as well as mine.
