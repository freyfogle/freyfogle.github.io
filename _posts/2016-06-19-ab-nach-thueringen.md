One of the great joys of having [a lifestyle business](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com) is ... the lifestyle.

As such I recently booked tickets for five weeks of summer break. The kids
and I - my wife unfortunately has to work the first few weeks - will be in [Heiligenstadt, Th√ºringen](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heilbad_Heiligenstadt) all of August. No plans, just go for hikes in the woods and swimming. We'll grill
some bratwurst. If you're around and want to swing by and say
hello - we're a ten minute walk from the train station - let me know. Also,
the various [Mittelpunkte Deutschlands](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mittelpunkt_Deutschlands) are all nearby, so there's plenty to do. 

May try to day trip it out to the old haunts in Weimar ...
