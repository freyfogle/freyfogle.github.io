Today I was reminded that I haven&rsquo;t yet written about <a href="http://giffgaff.com/orders/affiliate/freyfogle">giffgaff</a>. Giffgaff is a mobile network (I believe the industry term is MVNO) with much lower pricing than the big name networks, at least for my use case. I switched about a year ago and dropped my monthly mobile spend by about Â£30.


The service has some draw backs. First up, you need an unlocked phone. Secondly the website is not always easy to use, I&rsquo;ve found it to be painfully slow at times, and the wording and pricing with their &ldquo;goody bag&rdquo; concept is not always simple to understand. Finally I&rsquo;ve occasionally (though not always) had difficulties when traveling internationally. Despite all that this is a &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; service at a radically lower price point. I&rsquo;ve saved 100s of pounds by switching. 


If you want to try it out, please sign up <a href="http://giffgaff.com/orders/affiliate/freyfogle">via this link</a> which gives me cridt once you activate your sim.
