It has been a long time since I've written about angel investing here on 
the blog.

While there have been a few new, small investments, my main focus for 
the last 18 months has been much more on following on with existing investments.
I am fortunate that many companies I am an investor in have been raising new 
rounds*. Fundraising is of course only a milestone on the journey to building
a sustainable business, but 
still it is a good validation for a very early stage investor like me when 
late (usually institutional) investors come on board to help a company grow.
Sadly such fundraising can also eat up a lot of time - not least with Spanish 
companies that require a tedious trip to a notary. My strategy is almost always
to follow on when possible - though there are also times when I'm unable to 
for various reasons.

Still, this year I did make one less traditional investment; I became a 
limited partner (an LP, in the jargon of the trade) in [TinySeed](https://tinyseed.com/). TinySeed is a fund that invests in bootstrapped start-ups, mainly
those with a SaaS business model. The TinySeed model is very different than
most venture capital firms in that they invest a relatively small amount
($120-200k) in 
companies at a very early stage. Typically it is founders who have been 
working on their business as a side project who use the funding the funding 
to move to full time on the business. There is no expectation that future 
funding rounds will take place, ideally the money will be used to get the 
business to break even. Besides the money the TinySeed team provides a lot
of advice and tactical help, the founders in the first cohort all seem to be
getting a lot from the experience. 


This is an interesting rapidly emerging model (TinySeed is not the only player 
in the space), and a great indicator of the changing dynamics of digital 
entrepreneurship. Software services have made it simpler and less expensive for 
very small teams - typically based in much more affordable places than the
expensive tech hubs like SF - 
to build high-quality (and highly profitable) businesses
serving a global customer base.

So why have I invested

 * The fundamental trend that TS is riding is one we live daily on the 
SaaS start-up I am involved in: [OpenCage](https://opencagedata.com). I can see
how powerful the model of low costs and recurring revenue is. 

* Every investment is fundamentally a bet on the founders, TinySeed is no
different.
One of the co-founders of TinySeed is [Rob Walling](https://robwalling.com/),
one of the organizers of [MicroConf](https://microconf.com/). I met Rob when I
spoke at MicroConfEU two years ago in Lisbon and have been a long time listener
to his _[Startups for the rest of us](https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/)_
podcast. Rob has a unique skillset and audience for making TinySeed
a success.

* Fundamentally becoming an LP was also just a much more scalable way to get
investment access to many more great companies than I could reach on my own. 

The current TinySeed portfolio is a fantastic mix of interesting businesses.
Some I know well (I am delighted my friend Craig's podcast hosting startup
[Castos](https://castos.com/) is on the list), others I know only from their
website. By the nature of the investment thesis, most are niche businesses, so
I can't really try all the services out. But, in the niche is gold. 
Hopefully I'll be able to meet a few of the founders at the next
MicroConfEU in Dubrovnik in a few weeks.

Good luck to all the TinySeed founders (_if you're reading this, of course
feel free to ping me if there is any way for me to help your businesses_). Two
of the founders - Matt Wensing, of [SimSaaS](https://simsaas.co/),
and Peter Suhm, of [BranchCI](https://www.branchci.com/) - have a podcast called
_[Out of Beta](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/out-of-beta/id1470198478)_
which I've enjoyed listening along to. Give it a listen if you want to learn
more about their experiences in TinySeed. Also good is this interview
with [Einar Vollset](https://www.danmartell.com/einarvollset-tinyseed/), the
other TS co-founder, where he explains a bit more the business opportunity the fund is targeting.

On 1 November, applications will open for the second TinySeed cohort. I
encourage you to apply if you are in the target audience.
