It was my great pleasure to be interviewed by
[Chris Carpentier](https://twitter.com/CBCarpentier) of Telit
over on [the First Things First IoT podcast](https://www.firstthingsfirst.fm).

[The show notes and links to listen are here](https://www.firstthingsfirst.fm/project/thinking-outside-the-cage-the-geo-community-with-ed-freyfogle-of-opencage-data/) -
and they are worth checking out because they insisted I send a picture,
so you get a great action shot of me doing some "live" geocoding. We talk
about what we're up to at [OpenCage](https://opencagedata.com)
(_hint: it's still geocoding_), some background about
[#geomob](https://geomobldn.org), and also a bit about my geo angel investing
strategy. 

Enjoy, and let me know what you think.
