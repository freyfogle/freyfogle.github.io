    <p>After a very long break and frankly a terrible posting record, I am back on blogging for 2015. My record for week notes was, frankly, terrible, hence the title of today’s post. Nevertheless it was a start and one I hope to build on in 2015 as I continually got positive feedback and followup on the minimal level of posting I did in 2014. Later this week I’ll do a post looking back on the goals for 2014 and how they went (spoiler: mixed) but first I thought I’d do an update on where the last few months went.</p>

<p>First up, I was sick as a dog for about six weeks from mid-November through  Christmas. A terrible cold I just couldn’t shake, even though my kids (I suspect I got it from my daughter) got better very quickly. It was the sickest I’ve been in years.</p>

<p>My situation probably wasn’t helped by the fact that I traveled a ton. From late October to early December I went to Germany three times and Spain three times, basically one trip a week. Some of the trips, like <a href="http://www.freyfogle.com/post/102955218730/thoughts-on-whereberlin">the visit to Berlin for WhereCamp,</a> were good fun, but it definitely wears on me and breaks any sort of daily rhythm. But I think also the prolonged illness was probably at least partially driven by my poor exercise record over the last year. For the last 20 years I’ve exercised a ton, a mix of cardio and weights at least 3-4 times/week, but over the last year, while still walking and cycling everywhere and generally being active, I basically stopped all organized exercise, for no other real reason than laziness. So one of the goals for next year will definitely be to get fit again.</p>

<p>One of the trips was very bittersweet - my son and I went to my grandmother’s funeral in Thüringen. She had been in quite bad shape for a long time so it didn’t come as a surprise, and was just short of 90 years old, but it’s still very sad when it happens. It was a good chance though to see many distant relatives. I debated taking my son, as a four year old he obviously didn’t really get what was going on, but I’m very glad I did. It was great to see lots of distant relatives, and I think everyone was thankful to have a fun, small child there as a distraction.</p>

<p>During that trip we discovered some old family trees of my grandmother and grandfather going back seven or eight generations (almost all from <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heyerode">the same tiny village</a>) so I joined <a href="http://www.myheritage.com">MyHeritage</a> and digitized them, which was tedious but also pretty interesting. The service is a bit clunky, but has a very cool feature where they “smart match” you with other people who have uploaded the same ancestors, thus connecting your family trees. It’s easy to waste a lot of time exploring.</p>

<p>In more family news, my 14 month old daughter can now walk and climb, and is officially the cutest kid EVER. also of course we celebrated Christmas, which is great with a four year old, as per this foto:</p>

<p>And finally we celebrated new year’s eve north of the wall in rural Scotland, which was the most off the grid place I have been in a long while. We took the overnight train to/from Glasgow which was good fun. Highly recommend it.</p>

<p>In more work/financial focused news, lots happened:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://tech.eu/news/lokku-acquires-find-properly-nestoria/">We bought FindProperly</a>, which was (and remains) an interesting project, not least as it is our first acquisition. Hopefully we&rsquo;ll be rolling out some of the FP tech in non-UK Nestoria markets in the very near future. More soon.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.opencagedata.com/post/103156558698/video-of-lpw2014-talk">I attended and spoke at the London Perl Workshop</a> which was a great event.</li>
<li>I was <a href="http://www.realpundit.com/home/2014/ed-freyfogle-the-exclusive-interview-with-real-estate-search-engine-nestorias-co-founder">interviewed by RealPundit</a> (with video) and my friend Hrishi&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.gini.io/post/105532183738/how-lokku-built-a-profitable-business-innovating">Gini Blog</a>. I also got to <a href="http://geohipster.com/2014/11/25/steven-feldman-geohippies-want-make-difference-disruption-geo-evangelism-bit-altruism/">interview my friend Steven Feldman over on GeoHipster</a> and will be doing some more writing for them in the future.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m proud that Lokku <a href="http://blog.lokku.com/post/106050009453/thanks-for-a-great-year">was again able to support the great work of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.lokku.com/post/105599857283/most-of-the-lokku-team-celebrating-the-end-of-2014">We had the Lokku xmas party</a>, and due to being so sick I was the first person to call it a night.</li>
<li>Lots of developments in the various companies we&rsquo;ve invested in, great new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsiBdJ-XsoE">videos from SplashMaps</a> and <a href="http://vimeo.com/112184162">What3Words</a>. It&rsquo;s been lots of fun (and not infrequently a bit of pain) to watch and help these small companies grow.</li>
<li>We keep cranking on the <a href="http://geocoder.opencagedata.com/">OpenCage Data geocoder</a>. <a href="http://www.freyfogle.com/post/90803304030/starting-a-long-journey">The path forward is a long one</a>, but we&rsquo;re looking forward to coming out of beta in 2015. Meanwhile <a href="http://blog.opencagedata.com/tagged/interview">our interview series with anyone doing anything cool in open geo data</a> is going really well. Amongst many other good ones had the chance to interview Mark, my former boss from back in Yahoo! days over a decade ago, about<a href="http://blog.opencagedata.com/post/103405760558/open-geo-interview-series-mark-lester"> his amazing/insane project to crowdsource journey planning for south Asia</a>. Because he can. </li>
<li>After much debate, yesterday I sold my final bitcoin.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.overleaf.com/blog/190-writelatex-is-continued-overleaf">My friends at writeLaTeX rebranded as Overleaf</a>.</li>
<li>and no doubt much else that I&rsquo;ve forgotten, which is a shame. And a reason that I&rsquo;ll be blogging much more in 2015, which is so far on course to being my breakout year.</li>
</ul>
<p>more soon,
Ed</p>
